Code repository for my book on learning Page

This repository is currently ~~(12 December, 2019)~~ a work in progress.  (see below)

Code for each chapter can be found in the proper folder.

***UPDATE (Wednesday 7 October 2020):***

My book is now being published by a company in India.  I've completed two chapters and will be replacing the contents as time allows.  Once the book is published (hopefully January or February 2021), I will be placing the code here as well as images for the book. 

I don't know how soon I will be able to post the code due to not knowing how the publisher will react to it.  I, of course, will need to get their permission first.

I will keep updating this site as well as [thedesignatedgeek.xyz](thedesignatedgeek.xyz) as often as I can, sharing my progress.
